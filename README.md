## Background
I have created an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogues the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The dashboard can be accessed from the link: https://firdausmehta.github.io/Belly-Button-Biodiversity-Plot.ly/
